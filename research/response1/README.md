I have followed the tutorial for Kafka (https://github.com/CCBDA-UPC/Research-projects-2020/tree/master/02_Kaftka).

The tutorial starts with a very nice introduction of the motivation behind Kafka and gives a short overview into how 
and when it should be used. They also explain what to be expected from the tutorial, which is very nice when you're looking 
for tutorials that can be helpful in your work.

To use Kafka, you need to configure your environment and in the next section they describe how to do that with links to 
relevant guides. They list the requirements, but unfortunately they are missing one of them (Java for setting up the server),
which I didn't have. Therefore I needed to debug the error by looking for another tutorial. The authors of the guide 
probably already had Java installed (as most people do), so it is not strange that this was overlooked. Since they have listed several
resources for help, it didn't take long to fix the error.

After this they had two coding examples, one simple and one more advanced, which was a very good way to familiarize yourself 
with the technology. The increased difficulty as you got more familiar with Kafka was a nice way to progress. The second example
was an extension to an earlier assignment so you already had most of the code available. In addition to this they had their own coding
examples for the two exercies provided in case you got stuck.

Here are three screenshots from when I was doing the exercise:

All in all, I think it was a very well-made tutorial which was easy to follow. They also included some relevant cases where Kafka has been used
in production, which is nice since our examples more minimalistic.

I give the grade 9.5 / 10.
