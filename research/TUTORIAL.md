# Explore Data with Tableau

In this tutorial you will learn how to analyze data with [Tableau](http://tableau.com/) a leading Business Intelligence tool.
Tableau is one of the fastest growing data visualization tool in the Business Intelligence industry.
We choose tableau because it is perfect tool to create user friendly visualizations,
to perform in-depth analysis for disparate data sources and manage and customize visualizations to answer user queries.
Nowadays, a lot of data is generated from multitude sources and data visualization is a way of representing data in a graphical way.
Data visualization is very important because we human beings understand things that are visually well descriptive.
Data visualization tools help us to get a deep insight of the data by exploring useful information. 
Recently, human computer interaction is another discipline gaining a major attention from both users and data analyst experts.
Interacting with various data formats requires not only an appropriate analysis technique
but also choosing the right tool plays a vital role to obtain meaningful insights.
To address the data formats challenges taking into account the human interaction many visualization tools are already in the market.

From a different perspective, as we all are working with data directly or indirectly,
we firmly believe our work will benefit others to analyze their data in a better way to reach data driven decision.

The first step is to acquire suitable data, for our purposes we selected the data from ... source.
In a second step we will familiarize the student with the basic functionality and user interface of the tool, uploading the data and generating basic visualizations.
The third step a guide in deeper analysis generating more complex visualizations based on thorough analysis of the data.
